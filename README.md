## Hi, I'm Alex 👋

I am a software engineer / site reliability engineer. I am from Taiwan, a beautiful country that I always love with.

- 🔭  I’m currently working on [17LIVE](https://about.17.live/).
- 👨‍💻  I’m currently learning golang, software architecture and tâi-gí-lô-má-jī (台語羅馬字).
- 👯  I’m looking to collaborate on cloud architecture and golang projects.
- 😅  Fun fact: I'm very love nature observations, especially for birds!! Follow my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/siansian.bird) for my recently observations 📸

I'm looking for a job opportunity of software engineer and site reliability engineer (SRE).
