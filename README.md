### Hi I'm Alex 👋

I'm a site reliability engineer. I come from Taiwan, a beautiful country that I always love with.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [MoBagel](https://mobagel.com/), a company to build an AutoML platform.
- 👨‍💻 I’m currently learning golang and system design.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on web development.
- 😅 Fun fact: I'm very love nature observations, especially for birds!! Follow my [iNaturailist](https://www.inaturalist.org/people/alexsu) for recently observations 📷🐦

I'm looking for remote job opportunities of site reliability engineering.
